# SplashBuddy Web Template
A cleanly styled and animated web template for you all to use in SplashBuddy. Feel free to re-brand to meet your organisation's brand.


## Installation

## Notes
The WebView is setup with  fullPage.js and Animate.css plugins for smooth scrolling, text animation and slide based formatting. Can be customised heavily for anyone who wants to.
